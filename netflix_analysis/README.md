A collection of SQL queries and data analysis projects solving business problems.
**Netflix Content Strategy Analysis**

**Tools Used: PostgreSQL, pgAdmin 4**

**📌 Project Overview**
In this project, I performed a comprehensive analysis of the Netflix Titles dataset, which contains over 8,800 records of movies and TV shows available on the platform as of 2021. The goal was to understand Netflix's content distribution, identify key growth eras, and analyze regional production trends.

**🛠️ Technical Skills Demonstrated**
Data Engineering: Defined a relational schema and imported a large-scale CSV dataset into PostgreSQL.

Common Table Expressions (CTEs): Used CTEs to organize complex logic for cleaner, more readable queries.

Conditional Logic: Applied CASE WHEN statements to categorize titles into "Modern," "Recent," and "Classic" eras based on release_year.

Data Aggregation: Utilized GROUP BY, COUNT, and ORDER BY to generate business-ready reports.

**📊 Key Insights**
Modern Content Dominance: The vast majority of Netflix's library consists of "Modern" content (released 2015-2021), highlighting the platform's focus on fresh, original productions.

Global Production: The United States, India, and the United Kingdom emerged as the top contributors to the global library.

Format Split: While Movies make up the larger portion of the library (approx. 70%), TV Show additions have seen significant growth in recent years.
